# Application of Kernel on German Credit

- Compared the credit classification performance between Kernel Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine for categorical variables. 
- Compared the credit-amount prediction performance between Kernel Ridge Regression and Robust Regularized Kernel Regression for continuous variables.
- Applied cross validation to select best model for each method in regards to *labmda*.  
- Used the German credit data set which is available in the UCI. There were totally 1000 observations (700 good credits, 300 bad credits).
- Summarized the confusion matrix and graphs about fitted value against original value.

Report is in file **final_report.pdf**. Folder **R_code** contains all codes implemented in the project.
